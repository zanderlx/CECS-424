2.32 5.3	Released 05/25/99
 * Built with VisualC 6 SP2
 * Fixed saving out window dimensions when minimized
 * Fixed a bug that could prevent save game from working
 * Added ZMachine function keys (after Kirk Klobe pretty much did it for 
   me). There are icons on the icon bar, or you can use CTRL + Fkey. Yes,
   that's CONTROL + the key. I could not in good mind override the native
   assignment of the F1 key, which is help in all Windows apps. Would have
   confused newbies to no end.
 * At this point I am seriously considering throwing everything out the
   window and re-writing WinFrotz from the ground up as an object oriented,
   portable, extensible Z-Machine implementation. The current source is
   appalling. I will be thinking about this for the next month or so. Also,
   note that I have changed jobs and my new e-mail (home) is rich@cstone.net

2.32 R5.2b	Released 06/13/98
 * Released mostly to assure people I was still alive and thinking of the 
   Z-Machine (I've been getting e-mails).
 * Corrected a small refresh logic problem when prompted input was
   displayed (Terpetude)
 * Built with MFC dynamically linked instead of statically. This makes it 
   much smaller. There is a slight chance you will not have the required
   DLLs however. If this is the case download this file:
   http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/vc/mfc42.cab. If you have
   Internet Explorer it can install it automatically. If you don't, get 
   the Powertoys Cab Viewer at 
   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/powertoys/w95cabview/default.asp
 * Investigating supporting text-to-speech directly for the visually 
   impaired. I should get to this shortly.
 * Fixed the web page posting so the executable was actually there :-)

2.32 R5.2	Released 11/09/97
 * Corrected overwrite of previous text when inserting into the input line
   before the last character
 * Fixed a crash condition when Sound Options was accessed with no wave 
   device at all present.
 * Fixed sequence that could cause crashes when loading certain story files
   then loading a V6 game. This appeared to be a compiler bug, disturbingly
   enough. I hate when that happens.
 * Tandy bit was being set incorrectly, fixed.
 * Finally remembered to save toolbar and statbar state, so you can stop 
   piling up email about that.
