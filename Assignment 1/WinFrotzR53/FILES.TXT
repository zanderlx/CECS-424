ADVENT.Z5:
----------
You can use WinFrotz to play the supplied version of Classic Adventure (for
those not up on their interactive fiction history, this is the game that started
it all, long ago in 1977). I didn't create this version; I simply grabbed it off
of ftp.gmd.de in /if-archive/games/infocom. You can find walk-throughs and other
games there as well.

Original Adventure was written by Willie Crowther and Don Woods. David M.
Bagget and Graham Nelson worked to port it so it would run under Inform/ZIP 
interpreters (like WinFrotz).

To play, simply drag ADVENT.Z5 on top of the WinFrotz icon and release it.

FREEFALL.Z5:
------------
Freefall is an example of some of the versatility of the Z-code language. It's
not what you would consider a typical "interactive fiction" piece. This module
was written by Andrew Plotkin.
